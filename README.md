## GRACE DAYS
Grace days used for this assignment: < 1 >

Grace days remaining: < 4 >/5

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
I had a very difficult time when it came to forking the repositiory because it will consitently give me no errors but will not produce the same outcome that is produced on a second file that is not connected to the fork. This is very frustrating because it is the exact same code that seems to work in a normal python(with turtle) file, but will not work when connected to the repository.

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
I am submitting two links, one with the working code(not this), and this which is the repository. I am also putting a grace day on this even though it is on time so that I can speak with you after class and ask how to fix this.
